        <h1>Chapter 1 Tennis Racket</h1>
            <h2>Section 1 What to consider when buying a tennis racket</h2>
            <p>The best way to find out if a tennis racket is a good fit for you is to 
                demo a few rackets in person. Hit for a significant period of time to get 
                used to how the racket swings and feels. Remember to practice overheads, 
                volleys, and serves, and try to emulate how you’ll actually play with the r
                acket. Many brands, like Wilson, have try and buy programs, where you can try 
                out rackets for up to one week and then return them before you make a purchase. 
                The best picks will be the rackets you feel most comfortable with in head size, grip, 
                and weight—ones that don’t tire you out and allow you to swing and serve with ease.</p>
            <h2>Section 2 Common tennis racket terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Head size:</strong> The main, rounded part of the racket, which holds the 
                strings, can vary by size. Standard size is 27 inches long with a head between 85-97 
                square inches. Mid-sizes are slightly longer than 27 inches with a head size usually between 
                98-104 square inches, and oversized can be as long as 29 inches, with a head size over 105 
                square inches. Larger head sizes are good for beginners, helping them make contact with tennis 
                balls without wearing out their arm as they grow in skill level.</p>
            <p><strong>Balance:</strong> Balance refers to where the actual point of balance is located on 
                the racket. Headheavy rackets have a balance point that is closer to the head of the racket 
                versus right in the middle, while headlight rackets have a balance point closer to the butt 
                of the racket (below the grip).</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Tennis racket heads are made up of strings that run in a criss-cross pattern. Mains 
            are strings that run vertically, from the head to the throat of the racket, while cross 
            strings run perpendicular to the mains. Most brands communicate these patterns in their 
            specifications by using, for example, 16/19 or 16 inches x 19 inches. </p>
